# CMS using Reader-Writer Problem

## Description

This project demonstrates the **Reader-Writer problem** using **Java concurrency**. It simulates multiple threads reading and writing to articles in a simple **Content Management System (CMS)**. The project uses Javaâ€™s `ReentrantReadWriteLock` to ensure that multiple readers can access an article at the same time, but only one writer can modify it at a time.

## How It Works

- **Readers**: Multiple threads can read an article at the same time.
- **Writers**: Only one thread can write to an article, and it blocks other readers and writers while writing.

## Output

The program will show reading and writing activities from multiple threads and print the final content of all articles.
